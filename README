BEMU80
======

Bemu80 is a Z80 emulator written in C for Linux. It's currently almost fully functional, 
but expect some features not to work and the code to be a mess. More info coming soon.

Backstory
=========

Bemu80 is my 4th and final attempt at writing a Z80 emulator. 
So that's why the versioning starts at v0.4.0 and not v0.1.0.

Bemu80 is released under the GPL v2 license.
